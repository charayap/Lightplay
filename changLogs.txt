From last release version, the following v1.8-23.9.2020 contains the changes:

1. the blinking blue light(after booting) continues until it is done with mDNS registration and thus unlock the pairing button,
2. fix bug when router is open, i.e. no security, (STM MCU sends ssid = "xxx", and pwd = "" to me),
3. send "u8AlStandbyEn" tp STM MCU at sub-address 23 when value changed, together also send current AL mode
